# Quality Check & Code Review

## Overview
Comprehensive quality assurance workflow: run automated checks, auto-fix issues, and conduct code review using the checklist framework.

## Automated Quality Checks

### 1. Run checks in sequence
Execute in order, stopping at first failure:
- `npm run lint` → `npm run lint:fix` (auto-fix linting)
- `npm run type-check` (TypeScript validation)
- `npm run build` (compilation check)
- `npm run test` (test suite)
- `npm audit` (dependency security audit)

### 2. Fix issues automatically
- Fix one issue at a time, starting with the first failure
- Re-run the relevant check after each fix
- Continue only when current check passes
- Auto-fix formatting/linting issues when possible

### 3. Escalate complex issues
If a failure is ambiguous, requires domain knowledge, or could introduce errors:
- Report to user with specific error context
- Don't attempt risky fixes requiring human judgment

## Code Review Checklist

When automated checks pass or for manual review, verify:

### Functionality
- [ ] Code implements intended behavior
- [ ] Edge cases handled appropriately
- [ ] Error handling is robust
- [ ] No logic errors or bugs

### Code Quality
- [ ] Readable and well-structured
- [ ] Functions are focused and single-purpose
- [ ] Descriptive variable/function names
- [ ] No unnecessary duplication
- [ ] Follows project conventions

### Security
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Sensitive data handled securely
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Dependencies updated and secure
- [ ] Authentication secure
- [ ] Authorization properly configured

## Security Audit

When automated checks pass, perform comprehensive security review:

### 1. Dependency audit
- Check for known vulnerabilities (via `npm audit`)
- Update outdated packages
- Review third-party dependencies

### 2. Code security review
- Check for common vulnerabilities
- Review authentication/authorization
- Audit data handling practices

### 3. Infrastructure security
- Review environment variables
- Check access controls
- Audit network security

## Workflow
1. Run automated checks (including security audit) → auto-fix → verify
2. If all checks pass, use expanded checklist for final review (including security items)
3. Perform manual security audit review
4. If checks fail with complex issues, report and pause for guidance
